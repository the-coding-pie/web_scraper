## How to use it?

- First download the repository and unzip it.
- Then make a virtual environment using **venv** inside the root folder:

  ```python3 -m venv venv```

- Then activate the virtual environment. The command for that may vary depending on your os:
    - If your are on Mac/Linux):
    
      ```source venv/bin/activate```
    - If you are on windows:
    
      ```venv\Scripts\activate.bat```
- Then from within the root folder run:

  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- That's it now run the program using:

  ```python scraper.py```

## Requirements

- You should definetely need Python3.3+

The following are the required modules and I had put them inside the "requirements.txt" file:

```
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install lxml
```
You should also use ```venv``` for better working.
